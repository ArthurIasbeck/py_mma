# **AMB Design Tool**

Welcome to the Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB) Design Tool! This project allows you to design an AMB using Python 3.10.

## **Getting Started**

### Installation:

To start, install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal or command prompt.

## **Running the Project**

1. Run the [main.py](http://main.py/) file: `python main.py`
2. Access the frontend at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) to interact with the design tool.
3. Fill out the project parameters as prompted, and click on the "Executar dimensionamento" button (Portuguese for "Run Design") to generate a drawing of your AMB and view the results.

## **Using the Frontend**

The frontend is built using Taipy, which provides an intuitive interface for designing and visualizing your AMB. You can:

- Enter project parameters such as bearing dimensions, magnetic field strength, and more.
- Click on "Executar dimensionamento" to generate a drawing of your AMB design.
- View the results, including a graphical representation.
